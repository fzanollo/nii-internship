\begin{abstract}
	Although Social Network of actors is a relatively common object of investigation that has been addressed many times, we can say that seiyuu (anime voice actors) come from a very different industry with a distinct way to relate to each other. \\
	In this research we use Wikidata and MyAnimeList to collect seiyuu information and build a Social Network. Topics explored:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Structure and characteristics of seiyuu Social Network.
	\item Understanding what properties have a main role describing and predicting popularity of seiyuu.
	\item Compare prediction performances between different machine learning algorithms (and different models).
	\end{itemize}
