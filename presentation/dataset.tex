\subsection{Why seiyuu?}
\begin{frame}{Why seiyuu?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Because I \textbf{really} like anime and manga.

\item There are many researches whose focus is actor's social network but usually is hollywood actors and not only voice actors. Seiyuu and anime industry is really unusual and so could present a different structure.

\item There're several database with information about anime and seiyuu but they are either incomplete or don't have a good structure nor format.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Wikidata and MyAnimeList}
\begin{frame}{Wikidata and MyAnimeList}
We wanted to use \emph{Wikidata} as our source but it's too incomplete; it doesn't have information about works of seiyuu.
\vspace{15pt}

Instead we used \emph{MyAnimeList} (MAL) through an API called \emph{Jikan}; retrieving data in JSON and then changing its format to RDF.
\vspace{15pt}

We used Wikidata to get the list of seiyuu and MyAnimeList to get list of works for each seiyuu and information about anime.

%Thereâ€™s actually 7030 seiyuu in wikidata but only 6472 of them have an English label
\item Only 59 had MAL\_IDs
\item 3033 MAL\_IDs retrieved
\item At the end having 3092 seiyuu with MAL\_ID
\item 2956 of which had at least one work

\end{itemize}
